## Project Overview

This hackathon project experiments with various fire simulation techniques and implementations. The journey progressed from simple 2D cellular automata models to a fully-featured web application with real terrain data and weather integration.

## Experimental Modules

### 1. Basic Cellular Automata Implementation (`CA_implementation/`)

**Purpose:** Initial proof-of-concept for fire spread using cellular automata

**Technology:** Python + Pygame

**Features:**

- Simple grid-based fire propagation
- Mouse-click fire ignition
- Real-time visualization
- Basic reset functionality

**Key Learning:** Understanding fundamental cellular automata rules for fire spread modeling

### 2. 3D Visualization Experiments (`3d-forest-fire-simulation/`)

**Purpose:** Explore 3D rendering approaches for fire simulation

**Multiple Implementations:**

- **`main_software3d.py`** - Software-based 3D rendering (most successful)
- **`main_voxel.py`** - Matplotlib 3D voxel visualization
- **`main_opengl.py`** - Pure OpenGL implementation (graphics driver issues)
- **`main_3d.py`** - Ursina engine approach
- **`main_headless.py`** - 2D matplotlib fallback

**Key Challenge:** Graphics compatibility across different systems led to multiple rendering approaches

### 3. Real-World Data Integration (`Datasets/`)

**Purpose:** Incorporate actual meteorological and terrain data

**Components:**

- **ERA5 Weather Data (`ERA5.py`)** - Fetching real weather conditions from ECMWF
- **Land Use/Land Cover (`LULC-script.py`)** - Satellite-based terrain classification
- **Terrain Extraction (`TerrainExtract/`)** - Digital elevation model processing

**Key Innovation:** Moving from synthetic data to real-world conditions for more accurate modeling

## Hackathon Learnings

This project demonstrates the evolution from simple concepts to a complex system:

1. **Started simple** - Basic cellular automata with Pygame
2. **Explored alternatives** - Multiple 3D rendering approaches to handle compatibility issues
3. **Added realism** - Real-world data integration for accurate modeling
4. **Built for users** - Professional web interface for interactive simulation

The final web application successfully combines cellular automata theory, real-world data processing, and modern web technologies into a functional fire simulation platform.
